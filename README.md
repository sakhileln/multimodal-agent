# Simple Multimodal Agent
A beginner-friendly project to build a simple multimodal AI agent that processes text and image inputs and generates basic text outputs. The goal is to learn about AI concepts like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision while keeping the implementation lightweight and executable on a standard personal computer.

## Project Overview
This agent accepts:
- **Text Input**: A prompt or question (e.g., "What is in this image?").
- **Image Input**: A local image file (e.g., JPG or PNG).
- **Output**: A text response combining insights from both inputs (e.g., "The image shows a dog.").

The project uses Python and open-source libraries to process inputs locally without requiring advanced hardware or external APIs.

## Features

- Processes text using lightweight NLP tools (e.g., spaCy).
- Analyzes images using a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNet).
- Runs on a CPU-based system with minimal dependencies.
- Simple command-line interface for interaction.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A standard personal computer (no GPU required)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sakhileln/multimodal-agent.git
   cd multimodal-agent
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies
- `opencv-python`: For image processing.
- `tensorflow` or `keras`: For pre-trained image models (e.g., MobileNet).
- `spacy`: For text processing (run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm after installation).
- `numpy`: For general array operations.
- `pillow`: For image file handling.

#### Install them with:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python tensorflow spacy numpy pillow
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## Usage
- Run the agent with a text prompt and an image file:
   ```bash
   python multimodal_agent.py --text "What is in this image?" --image "path/to/dog.jpg"
   ```
- Example output:
   ```bash
   The image shows a dog.
   ```

## Project Structure
- `multimodal_agent.py`: Main script implementing the agent.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `sample_images/`: Directory for test images (e.g., dog.jpg).
